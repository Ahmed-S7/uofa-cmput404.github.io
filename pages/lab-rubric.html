    <h1>Lab Marking</h1>
<h2>Rubric</h2>
<p>Your grade on the lab is the percentage of your code that you <strong>completed and</strong> can demonstrate to the TA during your demo that you <strong>understand.</strong> You must be able to explain your code to the TA and explain why you chose to write your code the way you did.</p>
<p>For example, you might be asked to explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why you chose a certain structure?</li>
<li>Why you needed a particular variable?</li>
<li>The role a method serves in letting two classes communicate.</li>
<li>The difficulties you had when developing your code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that simply reading the code to the TA does <strong>not</strong> count as understanding.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ol>
<li>Example:<ul>
<li>Your code works perfectly. </li>
<li>You can explain your code to the TA during the demo.</li>
<li>Grade: 100</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example:<ul>
<li>Your code works perfectly.</li>
<li>You can explain most of your code to the TA during the demo, but you can't explain why you chose to use a <code>while</code> loop instead of a <code>for</code> loop for a critical component.</li>
<li>Grade: 90</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example:<ul>
<li>Your code works perfectly.</li>
<li>You can explain some of your code to the TA during the demo.</li>
<li>But, it seems like you don't understand half of the code for one of two problems in the lab.</li>
<li>Grade: 75</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example:<ul>
<li>Your code is halfway complete.</li>
<li>You can explain your code perfectly.</li>
<li>Grade: 50</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example:<ul>
<li>Your code works perfectly.</li>
<li>You can only explain half of your code.</li>
<li>Grade: 50</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example:<ul>
<li>Your code is halfway complete.</li>
<li>You can only explain half of your code.</li>
<li>Grade: 25</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example:<ul>
<li>Your code works perfectly.</li>
<li>You can't explain any of your code, and it doesn't seem like you understand it at all.</li>
<li>Grade: 0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example:<ul>
<li>Your code mostly works. The TA estimates it is 80% done.</li>
<li>You can't explain any of your code, and it doesn't seem like you understand it at all.</li>
<li>Grade: 0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example:<ul>
<li>Your code doesn't work at all.</li>
<li>Grade: 0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example:<ul>
<li>Your code looks like it isn't even for the current lab</li>
<li>Grade: 0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example:<ul>
<li>Your code works perfectly</li>
<li>You can explain your code to the TA with no problem</li>
<li>But, you forgot to submit it on eClass</li>
<li>Grade: no grade (but this counts the same as a 0)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example:<ul>
<li>Your code works perfectly</li>
<li>You can explain your code to the TA with no problem</li>
<li>But, you plagiarized, misrepresented your work, or other academic misconduct (cheating)</li>
<li>Grade: 100, and you get interviewed by the instructor, and you get interviewed by the Dean's office, and you probably get sanctioned by the Dean's office, and you probably recieve letter of reprimand, and the Dean's officer can set your grade to 0 anyway. Or the Dean's officer might fail you for the entire course, or whatever they decide, they have their own rules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
