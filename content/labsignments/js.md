# Description

In this lab you will make a JS Clock/Timer/Alarm/Stopwatch "single-page" app.
The app won't require any network traffic except loading a single HTML file.
You will use DHTML, promises, and async/await to connect your code and make sure each piece of code runs at the same time, and that the Clock, Timer, Alarm, and Stopwatch functions all work at the same time, independently.

## Learning Goals

* Basic DOM manipulation
* A thorough understanding of promises, async, await.
* Combining JS, HTML, and CSS into a single file.

# Getting Started

1. Get the GitHub classroom link from eClass, create your assignment, and clone it.
2. Create an appropriate `.gitignore` file, to prevent unwanted files being committed to your repository. (See Django/Heroku labs for tips.)

# Requirements

* All JS and CSS are bundled into the single HTML file.

# Submission Instructions

Make sure you push to GitHub classroom **BEFORE 4PM on the day of your lab section!** You will not be able to push after that!

Submit a link to your repo in the form `https://github.com/uofa-cmput404/w24-h0x-labsignment-js-yourgithubname`. **Do not** submit a link to a branch, a file, or the clone URL. If you do not do this we will not know which GitHub submission is yours.

<p class="warning">If you do not submit a link to your repo on eClass on time using the correct format above, you will get a zero.</p>
