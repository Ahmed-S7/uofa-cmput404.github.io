<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The web is fundamentally interconnected and peer to peer. There's
no really great reason why we should all use facebook.com or
google+ or MySpace or something like that. If these social networks
came up with an API you could probably link between them and use
the social network you wanted. Furthermore, you might gain some
autonomy.</p>
<p>Thus, in the spirit of diaspora https://diasporafoundation.org/ 
(Diaspora was the predecessor to Mastodon)
we want to build something like diaspora but far, far simpler.</p>
<p>This blogging/social network platform will allow the importing of
other sources of information (GitHub) as well allow the
distribution and sharing of posts and content.</p>
<p>An author sitting on one node can aggregate
the posts of authors they follow on other nodes.   </p>
<p>We are going to go with an inbox model where you share posts to
your followers by sending them your posts. This is similar to
activity pub: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/ ActivityPub
is the protocol that powers most distributed social media such
as Mastodon.
Activity Pub is great, but too complex for a class project.</p>
<p>We also won't be adding much in the way of encryption or security
to this platform. We're keeping it simple and restful.</p>
<p>Choose at least 3 other groups to work with!</p>
<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<p>I log into SocialDistribution. I see my stream which is filled with
posts that have arrived in my inbox combined with public posts that my node knows about.
I browse them and I click like on anything by my friend Steph who is on another node.</p>
<p>When I click like, my node sends a like object to Steph's inbox
that references her post.</p>
<p>I then comment on Steph's post. This sends a comment object to
Steph's inbox that references her post.</p>
<p>Steph's node will process events at her inbox and record the
comments and likes appropriately.</p>
<p>Then I write a public post, a public service announcement (PSA)
about how public service announcements are pretentious preformative
social media, and you shouldn't make them. The irony is lost on me.
I make an unlisted image post that contains an image for the PSA
and reference it from my PSA post. Nonetheless, my node records my
post and makes a URL for both posts and then proceeds to send my
public posts to the inboxes of everyone who follows me. My node
knows who follows me and thus can just send the public post to each
of those inboxes. Perhaps there will be a scaling problem in the
future.</p>
<p>Later I write a friends-only post about how much I hate the movie The Room (2003).
Tommy Wiseau can't see it because I'm not friends with Tommy Wiseau, but this post is sent to Steph's inbox, and she can see it because she's my friend.</p>
<p>When Steph logs into her node she'll see her stream and my public
post and my friends-only post will be on her stream.
She should also see that I've liked and commented her post.</p>
<h4 id="scenario-summary">Scenario Summary</h4>
<p>All actions from authors are routed through the inbox of the receiving authors by the node itself.</p>
<p>Nodes will store copies of posts because they receive them in the inbox.</p>
<p>Likes and comments on posts are all sent to the inbox of the author.</p>
<p>Public posts are sent to the inboxes of all followers of the author.</p>
<p>Friends-only posts are sent to the inboxes of all friends of the author.</p>
<p>Posts, likes, comments, posts, are all sent to the inboxes of the authors that should be able to see them.</p>

<p>Notes on the above tables:
    * This can work entirely on push from the author's server to another author's inbox.
    * Yes, this means that only the local node (node where the post came from) will have a complete list of comments/likes. Mastodon/Diaspora also have this problem.
    * "Unfollow" the API is missing this functionality.
    * Yes, a node may have an out of date list of followers if a remote follower unfollows.
    * "View Friends-Only" the API is missing this functionality. </p>
<h4 id="authentication">Authentication</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remote node authentication is global between nodes. It requires an admin to allow node to node access.</li>
<li>Remote node authentication is done solely with HTTP basic auth</li>
<li>Local auth uses your local auth mechanisms (cookies, tokens, basic auth).</li>
<li>Local auth is between an author's UI and an author's node server.<ul>
<li>It could be the web UI you make</li>
<li>It could also be another custom UI (like an android app)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Local refers the RESTful API for authors on that node.<ul>
<li>This is useful for frameworks like react, vue, or angular to get access to data, and enable a more client heavy UI.</li>
<li>Even if your frontend does not use them, endpoints marked [local] should be usable by a future Android/iOS client to achieve the same functionality as frontend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pagination">Pagination</h4>
<p>If something is paginated it has query options:</p>
<ul>
<li>page - how many pages of objects have been delivered</li>
<li>size - how big is a page</li>
<li>Page 4 of objects http://service/author/{author_id}/posts/{post_id}/comments?page=4</li>
<li>Page 4 of objects but 40 per page http://service/author/{author_id}/posts/{post_id}/comments?page=4&amp;size=40</li>
<li>1 based indexing. First page is 1.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<ul>
<li>HTTP Methods (PUT POST GET DELETE) not explicitly listed are not allowed methods<ul>
<li>Most HTTP methods are local API only, and provided for local node use.</li>
<li>Local node use means for use by the frontend to communicate with the backend it came from.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are free to add your own endpoints for local node use, but you must document and test them.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="who-talks-to-who">Who talks to Who</h4>
<ul>
<li>Required: The backends talk to each other, mostly trough POST requests to the <code>inbox</code> URLs for remote authors.</li>
<li>Optional: The frontend talks to the backend for the same node.</li>
<li>Forbidden: The frontend talks to a backend of another node. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<p>Almost all node-to-node communication proceeds by the node where something (post/like/comment/follow request) was created POSTing that thing that was created to the relevant authors inbox on a remote node.</p>
<p>node-to-node (marked as "[remote]") request other than "POST to inbox" are rarely needed, but you should support them in case the remote node needs to check something.</p>
<h4 id="example-node-to-node-api-view">Example (node-to-node API View)</h4>
<p>The Frontend-to-Backend (also known as [local]) communication for this scenario is up to your team, this only describes the Backend-to-Backend communication between two different nodes.</p>
<ol>
<li>I sign up for SocialDistribution on http://node1</li>
<li>node1 administrator approves my account.</li>
<li>Now an author object exists that represents me at http://node1/api/authors/555555555</li>
<li>I use the interface to make a follow request to Steph, who is node2/api/authors/777777777</li>
<li>My node POSTs the follow request to Steph's inbox at http://node2/api/authors/777777777/inbox</li>
<li>When Steph logs in, she sees my follow request and approves it.</li>
<li>Now Steph's node (node2) knows that I am following her.</li>
<li>Steph makes a public post.</li>
<li>Steph's node (node2) sends Steph's new post to my inbox with POST http://node1/api/authors/555555555/inbox.</li>
<li>I eventually see Steph's new post, and click like on it.</li>
<li>My node sends the like to Steph's inbox with POST http://node2/api/authors/777777777/inbox</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="image-posts">Image Posts</h4>
<p>Image Posts are just posts that are images. But they are encoded as base64 data.
You can inline an image post using a data URL, or you can use this 
shortcut to get the image if authenticated to see it.</p>
<ul>
<li>URL: ://service/authors/{AUTHOR_ID}/posts/{POST_ID}/image<ul>
<li>GET [local, remote] get the public post converted to binary as an image</li>
<li>return 404 if not an image</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This end point decodes image posts as images. This allows the use of image tags in Markdown.</li>
<li>You can use this to proxy or cache images.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="comments">Comments</h4>
<ul>
<li>URL: ://service/authors/{AUTHOR_ID}/posts/{POST_ID}/comments<ul>
<li>GET [local, remote] get the list of comments of the post whose id is POST_ID (paginated)</li>
<li>POST [local] if you post an object of "type":"comment", it will add your comment to the post whose id is POST_ID</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implement the webservice as described in the user stories</li>
<li>Provide a webservice interface that is restful</li>
<li>Provide a web UI interface that is usable</li>
<li>Prove your project by connecting with at least 1 clone of your project. (Parts 3-5)</li>
<li>Prove your project by connecting with at least 2 other groups. (Parts 4-5)</li>
<li>Show that you are making a serious effort to connect with at least 4 other groups. (Parts 4-5)</li>
<li>Prove your project by connecting with at least 3 other groups. (Part 5)</li>
<li>Make a video demo of your blog (desktop-recorder is ok) <ul>
<li>Your video may <strong>not</strong> be a part of your presentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make a presentation about your blog </li>
<li>Follow the guidelines in the <a href="../general/project.html">project spec</a> for URLs and services</li>
<li>Allow users to accept or reject follow requests</li>
<li>Images get the same protection that posts get as they are POSTS</li>
<li>Follow the <a href="#api-requirements">API requirements</a> in the following section</li>
<li>Follow the <a href="#infrastructure-and-software-requirements">Infrastructure and Software Requirements</a> in the following section</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="api-requirements">API Requirements</h4>
<p>When building your API, try to adhere to these rules for easy compatibility with other groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>REST API calls may be prefixed. ie. <code>http://service_address/api/authors/{AUTHOR_ID}/posts/</code></li>
<li>Document your service address, port, hostname, prefix(if used), and the username/password for HTTP Basic Auth in your README so that HTTP clients can connect to your API.</li>
<li>You <strong>must</strong> be compatible with the API specification and examples listed above in this document. <ul>
<li>You <strong>may</strong> need to add some additional things for compatibility with other groups due to varying interpretations.</li>
<li>You <strong>may</strong> add additional endpoints and JSON keys as long as you provide the ones listed above.</li>
<li>If you follow something close to, but not compatible with the API specification in this document, then you will get something close to, but not exactly, a good grade.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="test-requirements">Test Requirements</h4>
<p>The REST API must be fully tested.
    * Every API endpoint must be tested.
    * Every API functionality must be tested.
    * Every API method must be tested.
    * Every user story must be tested at the API level.
    * If a user story does not have an API, it must be tested by calling the Django code directly.
    * Tests that don't actually test what they say they're testing do not count.</p>
<p>These would be system/acceptance tests if the project didn't have a frontend.</p>
<p>Testing the user stories at the API level should give you the tests you need for every API endpoint, every API functionality, and every API method.
<strong>Pretend you are writing tests to make sure a future Android client will work with your API.</strong></p>
<p>Not every user story has an API to test. For example, adding/removing nodes to connect with usually does not have an API. For these functions, please test them in whatever way is most convenient for your project, and then verify them using the API. You could write a test that adds a node to connect with by calling Python code or modifying the database directly, then use the API to check that the new node connection is working.</p>
<p>Frontend (Selenium, etc.) tests are not required. Code coverage (line coverage, statement coverage, branch coverage, MC/DC, etc.) is not required. Unit testing is not required.</p>
<h4 id="documentation-requirements">Documentation Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Every API endpoint is documented.</li>
<li>Every API endpoint has multiple examples.</li>
<li>Every JSON field in both request and response<ul>
<li>Has a type </li>
<li>Has an example value</li>
<li>Has an explanation of its purpose (when to use it)</li>
<li>For the request</li>
<li>For the response</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explanation of anything interesting about each endpoint<ul>
<li>Whether it is paginated, ...<ul>
<li>How to use the pagination, ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Code is well organized and has good style<ul>
<li>Readable</li>
<li>No smells such as "god files/classes/functions"</li>
<li>Each folder/file/class/function only does one thing</li>

<h4 id="infrastructure-and-software-requirements">Infrastructure and Software Requirements</h4>
<aside class="longWarning">
<p><strong>Failure to meet these requirements will result in a score of zero for project parts.</strong></p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you make your frontend using HTML, CSS, JS. You can use Jinja templates (it comes with Django) or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components">WebComponents</a>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>We will not be covering frontend frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue, Solid, Svelte... (there are dozens of these) in lecture or in lab, for a number of reasons:
        <ul>
            <li>We don't have time to cover this during the semester. It would require a second semester to cover these.<ul>
                <li>You will have to learn how to work with these frameworks yourself.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>React is losing popularity.<ul>
                <li>In ten years, knowing React will not be valuable anymore, because everyone will redo their websites in something else. This already happened with jQuery. 10 years ago all the 404 students wanted to learn jQuery, and now people barely use it.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>There is no standard frontend framework other than plain HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
            <li>The fact that large businesses like Facebook, Google, and Walmart use them does not mean they are good for a small semester project with a small team.</li>
            <li>All of the React-style (reactive paradigm) frameworks have major flaws that cannot be fixed, because the paradigm itself is flawed.</li>
            <li>All of the React-style (reactive paradigm) frameworks and most of the other frameworks are much more difficult to debug than plain JS or JS with a few libraries. This is because they make it difficult or impossible to determine why a component is being rerendered. They make it difficult or impossible to trace the code backwards from an error to the source of the problem.</li>
            <li>All of the component-based frameworks produce really bad HTML for the browser that is also difficult to debug or understand how it was produced.</li>
            <li>All frameworks using a shadow DOM are difficult to debug because the DOM updates are applied all at once, instead of step-by-step.</li>
            <li>All of the important contributions of React (components, shadow DOM, scoped CSS) have already been added to native HTML/CSS/JS, removing the need for React.<ul>
                <li>Once again, this already happened with jQuery. All the good parts of jQuery got added to native JS, and now people barely use it.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>A strong knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS allows you to quickly learn any framework, while knowing one framework does not teach you much about HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
            <li>It's very easy to make your own React-style frontend framework. There is nothing special about React. React's popularity comes from the fact that Facebook made it. Angular is popular because Google made it.</li>
            <li>Any particular frontend framework may not be able to meet the project requirements.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>TAs will not help you with frontend frameworks.</li>
    <li>Every semester there are at least a few students who choose to use a frontend framework and then, as a result:<ul>
        <li>End up having to redo large amounts of work when the framework turns out to not meet the requirements of the project</li> 
        <li>End up not being able to get parts of their application working due to the complexity and difficulty of debugging the framework code</li>
        <li>End up with a web app that is incredibly slow</li>
        <li>End up needing custom API endpoints which aren't specified above, so they have to do extra work</li>
        <li>End up fighting among themselves because only one teammember can understand the framework</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use React or a similar frontend framework such as Angular, Vue, Solid, Svelte... (there are dozens of these), despite these warnings, then all team members must fill out the frontend framework form. We offer this option only becuase some students want the experience for their resumé. However, it involves extra work. If <strong style="color: darkred;">all team members</strong> do not fill out the frontend framework form agreeing to use a front end framework despite the extra work required and the above warnings then you are not allowed to use a frontend frameworks, and using them will result in a mark of zero.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Backend frameworks are limited to Django and Flask only. We suggest Django. Flask requires extra work.</li>
    <li>Server-side rendering is limited to Jinja templates (provided by Django), or another templating engine that can run in Django/Flask.</li>
    <li>Combined frontend-backend frameworks, and server-side component rendering is not allowed unless you can get it working in Django on Heroku.<ul>
        <li>Server side rendering requiring a node server is not allowed.</li>
        <li>Anything requiring a node server is not allowed.</li>
        <li>Next.js, ... and similar frameworks are not allowed.</li>
    </ul></li>

<ul>
<li>These optional. They are just advice. They usually lead to less conflict and a better end result.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most successful teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use pull requests.<ul>
<li>Pull requests are great in general, but they tend to cause problems because the project is very small and groups are also small.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use very very few branches (e.g. production and staging).<ul>
<li>Do not use author branches (or branches where a single author is the only one touching them).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commit, pull, push the code they're working on, to the same branch that everyone else is working on, at least once an hour.<ul>
<li>Commit code that doesn't break the overall project.</li>
<li>Avoid your version being broken for more than an hour.</li>
<li>Do not stay up all night, change everything, and push a hundred changes all over the code base as one giant pull request.</li>

<h3 id="marking">Marking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Usually all teammates will share the same mark.</li>
<li>An individual student's marks will be reduced if the instructor (or a TA in consultation with the instructor) finds that:<ul>
<li>The student is not contributing or contributing significantly less than their teammates.</li>
<li>The individual student is significantly preventing their teammates from participating or contributing.</li>
<li>The individual student's is significantly misusing git/GitHub/Heroku/other software tools.</li>
<li>The indivudual student is engaging in significant "intellectual violence."<ul>
<li>Intellectual violence is when one teammate uses their skill, knowledge, or experience, to intimidate or control the other teammate(s) rather than sharing and helping them learn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The individual student is not communicating or only communicating very rarely with their team.</li>
<li>The individual student does not complete the peer feedback form (-1 mark for each part 1-4).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any concerns about teamwork must be brought to the instructor's (not the TA) attention <em>by email</em> well before the last lab.<ul>
<li>It takes time to investigate these things. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="overall-marking">Overall Marking</h4>
<ul>

<li>Excellent: Adheres to standards, code is well organized and clean. Code is easy to read. Comments add to code readablility when necessary. Code meets Python, JS, HTML and CS style guides. Excellent indentation, naming. Code units only do one thing. It's easy to find the code responsible for handling any of the ½ user stories.</li>
<li>Good: Adheres to standards, code is well organized and clean. Missing comments. Some minor issues with code style. Code units only do one thing. It takes a little digging sometimes to find the code responsible for a user story.</li>
<li>Satisfactory: Adheres to standards, there is an attempt at organization. Commented out code, unreachable code, or code with no clear purpose. Code units only do one thing. Occasional spots of poor style. It's not clear where the code for a user story will be.</li>
<li>Unsatisfactory: Browser, Python, transpiler, bundler, etc. warnings. Code is poorly organized God files/classes/functions. Have to search or grep code to find the code responsible for something.</li>

<h5 id="presentation">Presentation</h5>
<p>Your presentation will be 5 minutes max. Then you will have a minute or two for questions.</p>
<p>Your presentation should focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Important functions<ul>
<li>You won't have time for every function in 5 minutes, so make sure to cover the most important functions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your UI<ul>
<li>This is what makes your project different from the other teams, so be sure to show it off!</li>
<li>We don't really need to see the Django admin panel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Federation<ul>
<li>Walkthroughnstrate your working connection with other team(s).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Guide for a good presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, everyone in your team should take turns speaking.<ul>
<li>However, I do understand that some people have public speaking anxiety, so you won't be penalized if someone doesn't speak.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideally, your presentation will use your live web app.<ul>
<li>The most successful teams in the past use note cards.</li>
<li>Prepare backup slides in case something goes wrong that prevents you from doing a live demo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The best presentations tell a story, walking through a typical user scenario.<ul>
<li>An example of such a scenario is the one in the "Scenario" section above. But don't use that one, come up with your own that shows
off your app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rehearse your presentation in person as a team to make sure it is close to 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Make sure your team has a laptop that works with the projector <em>before</em> the presentation day.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the other team's presentations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rudeness to the other teams will not be tolerated.</li>
<li>Your team must arrive on time. Late teams will not be allowed to present.</li>
<li>You and your team must stay for all presentations and show respect, support, and appreciation for the other teams hard work.</li>
<li>You may ask thoughtful questions after each presentation.</li>
<li>Wait until after questions to applaud. Otherwise, everyone ends up awkwardly applauding each team twice.</li>
